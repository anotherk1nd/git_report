\section{Contributions}
Data was extracted from from \cite{Cappellari2011} and \cite{Krajnovic2013} principally. I performed all of the data analysis and plots except for those in the introduction which are referenced. The code utilised metrics and algorithms from the SKLEarn module. Pandas were also used for data handling and for the scatter matrices. Matplotlib was used for the majority of plots. I would also like to thank my supervisor for the extended discussions we had over the duration of the project and his endless knowledge.
