abstract = {We analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the $\backslash$nATLAS3D sample by fitting a single S{\'{e}}rsic profile and$\backslash$ndecomposing all non-barred objects (180 of 260 objects) in two$\backslash$ncomponents parametrized by an exponential and a general S{\'{e}}rsic$\backslash$nfunction. The aim of this analysis is to look for signatures of discs in$\backslash$nlight distributions of nearby early-type galaxies and compare them to$\backslash$nkinematic properties. Using S{\'{e}}rsic index from single-component$\backslash$nfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- and$\backslash$nearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. Assuming that objects with n$\backslash$n{\textgreater} 3 are slow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent$\backslash$nprobability to correctly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per$\backslash$ncent of previously classified as ellipticals). We show that exponential$\backslash$nsub-components, as well as light profiles fitted with only a single$\backslash$ncomponent of a low S{\'{e}}rsic index, can be linked with the kinematic$\backslash$nevidence for discs in early-type galaxies. The median disc-to-total$\backslash$nlight ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0, respectively.$\backslash$nSimilarly, the median S{\'{e}}rsic indices of the bulge (general$\backslash$nS{\'{e}}rsic component) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators,$\backslash$nrespectively. Overall, discs or disc-like structures are present in 83$\backslash$nper cent of early-type galaxies which do not have bars, and they show a$\backslash$nfull range of disc-to-total light ratios. Discs in early-type galaxies$\backslash$ncontribute with about 40 per cent to the total mass of the analysed$\backslash$n(non-barred) objects. The decomposition into discs and bulges can be$\backslash$nused as a rough approximation for the separation between fast and slow$\backslash$nrotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a 59 per cent$\backslash$nprobability to correctly recognize slow rotators. We find trends between$\backslash$nthe angular momentum and the disc-to-total light ratios and the$\backslash$nS{\'{e}}rsic index of the bulge, in the sense that high angular$\backslash$nmomentum galaxies have large disc-to-total light ratios and small bulge$\backslash$nindices, but there is none between the angular momentum and the global$\backslash$nS{\'{e}}rsic index. We investigate the inclination effects on the$\backslash$ndecomposition results and confirm that strong exponential profiles can$\backslash$nbe distinguished even at low inclinations, but medium-size discs are$\backslash$ndifficult to quantify using photometry alone at inclinations lower than$\backslash$n˜50°. Kinematics (i.e. projected angular momentum) remains the$\backslash$nbest approach to mitigate the influence of the inclination effects. We$\backslash$nalso find weak trends with mass and environmental density, where$\backslash$ndisc-dominated galaxies are typically less massive and found at all$\backslash$ndensities, including the densest region sampled by the$\backslash$nATLAS3D sample.},

abstract = {We investigate the relationship between stellar and gas specific angular momentum {\$}j{\$}, stellar mass {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\$} and optical morphology for a sample of 488 galaxies extracted from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. We find that {\$}j{\$}, measured within one effective radius, monotonically increases with {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\$} and that, for {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\textgreater}{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}9.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, the scatter in this relation strongly correlates with optical morphology (i.e., visual classification and S$\backslash$'ersic index). These findings confirm that massive galaxies of all types lie on a plane relating mass, angular momentum and stellar light distribution, and suggest that the large-scale morphology of a galaxy is regulated by its mass and dynamical state. We show that the significant scatter in the {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}-j{\$} relation is accounted for by the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, the contribution of ordered motions to the dynamical support of galaxies varies by at least a factor of three. Indeed, the stellar spin parameter (quantified via {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}R{\$}) correlates strongly with S$\backslash$'ersic and concentration indices. This correlation is particularly strong once slow-rotators are removed from the sample, showing that late-type galaxies and early-type fast rotators form a continuous class of objects in terms of their kinematic properties.},

By taking advantage of re-solved stellar kinematics out to one e{\_}ective radius (re), these projects have shown that the kinematic properties of early-type galaxies are not strongly correlated with their stellar light distribution pg 2 
It seems there are 2 methods of measuring galaxy rotation, either via the spin parameter lambda that Capellari formulated, or vie the specific angular momentum 
In order to investigate the link between stellar and gaskinematics and morphology, we use one parametric and one non parametric indicator, the S{\_}ersic index measured in r-band (nr, Kelvin et al. 2012) andconcentration index (de-{\_}ned as the ratio of the SDSS Petrosian radii containing 90{\%} and 50{\%} of the total r-band luminosity R90=R50), respectively.

	abstract = {We analyse the orbital distribution of E and S0 galaxies using SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics. We construct the anisotropy (V/sigma,epsilon) diagram, for the 48 E/S0 galaxies from the SAURON survey. For a subsample of 24 galaxies consistent with axisymmetry, we use three-integral axisymmetric Schwarzschild dynamical models to recover the detailed orbital distribution and we find good agreement with the anisotropy derived from the (V/sigma,epsilon) diagram. In the companion Paper IX we show that the early-type galaxies can be subdivided into two classes of systems with or without a significant amount of specific stellar angular momentum. Here we show that the two classes have different distributions on the (V/sigma,epsilon) diagram. The slow rotators are more common among the most massive systems and are generally classified as E from photometry alone. Those in our sample tend to be fairly round (epsilon{\textless}0.3), but can have significant kinematical misalignments, indicating that as a class they are moderately triaxial, and span a range of anisotropies (delta{\textless}0.3). The fast rotators are generally fainter and are classified either E or S0. They can appear quite flattened (epsilon{\textless}0.7), do not show significant kinematical misalignments (unless barred or interacting), indicating they are nearly axisymmetric, and span an even larger range of anisotropies (delta{\textless}0.5). These results are confirmed when we extend our analysis to 18 additional E/S0 galaxies observed with SAURON. All these results support the idea that fast rotators are nearly oblate and contain disk-like components. The role of gas must have been important for their formation. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial. Current collisionless merger models seem unable to explain their detailed observed properties. (Abridged)},
